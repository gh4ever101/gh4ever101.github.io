## Chapter 2: Ludwig the Conqueror (1080–1149)

In 1080, Count Ludwig the Elder passes and leaves his lands to his two sons, Ludwig the Younger and Berengar Ludowinger. The majority of the lands—those centered around Schmalkalden and the old capital Orlamünde—pass to Ludowig, while the easternmost parts of the realm are passed to Berengar. Both continue to pay homage to their liege, Ludwig the Younger's daughter Margravine Adelheid II of Meissen, now only four years of age.

While his father used his duplicitous talents to further the status of his dynasty, the new Count Ludwig II uses his talents to seduce women. The latest of his whims is the brawny Bia von Bärenburg. A naive woman, she has quickly fallen for the donjuanesque ways of Ludwig II.

Before his passing, Count Ludwig I warned his son to control his impulses for the sake of the fledgling dynasty. For if their modest lands were to split any further among many heirs, their already weak realm would surely be lost to the annals of time.

Before the corpse is cold, Bia announces she is expecting.

Due to his education—and aided by practicing smooth words on women—Ludwig II is a reasonable diplomat. As such, his early reign is spent with both his landed brother and daughter, and growing into his role as the Ludowinger partiarch. Furthermore, perhaps due to his own unlikely marriage with the previous Margravine out of a position of relative obscurity, rumors quickly spread of the eligibility of the single members of the dynasty.

In the meantime, Ludwig II sends Baron Hermann to neighboring rulers in the hopes of fostering both good relations and good will. A symptom of the Baron's previous position as the Schmalkalden spymaster also means more information about neighboring realms is gathered surreptitiously.

To the east, past the lands of Silesia that Ludwig I fought in, lie the Dual Kingdoms of Ruthenia and Galicia–Volhynia. Further still to the north and east lie the Grand Principalities of Chernigov and Novgorod. Only a few generations ago, these lands were all united under a single Rurikid banner, but a plurality of heirs has progressively split the dynasty into a multitude of independent houses.

Closer to home, the heir of the Kingdom of Poland is the young Prince Bezprym. His ancestry was recently called into question by Count Ludwig I. Will the Kingdom be weakened for it?

Further west, holy wars rage across the Iberian peninsula. The southern half is ruled by the Muslim remnants of the self-proclaimed Caliphate of Córdoba, while the northern half the Catholic remnants of the self-proclaimed Empire of León. Through an unfortunate accident involving the death of the King García of Galicia, Alfonso VI of León has inherited his elder brother's lands in the northwest of the peninsula.

After putting down revolts in Normandy, King Philippe has maintained a solid grip of France.

Though he lost on the battlefield to Harald Hardrada, Harold Godwineson escaped with his life and managed to retreat to his lands in Dorset to lick his wounds. With the accession of the relatively unpopular bastard King Magnus to the English throne, Harold has seized his chance to take back his rightful throne.

Finally, at home, the Kaiser struggles to maintain a cohesive Empire, and is almost eight hundred florins in debt. Only a few years ago, the excommunicated Kaiser Heinrich IV just barely won an independence war started by the devout Northern Italian Catholics, and only at the cost of serious concessions to his South German vassals. Caught between the crossfires of these wars, the Kaiser's vassals in the Alps and the peasants of Bavaria are fed up with imperial politics, and take this moment of weakness as a chance to secede.

Back in Schmalkalden, Bia bears a daughter, not due to any inheritance. However, in the ensuing festivities, Ludwig II and Bia conceived another child—nine months later, Bia bears a son! In the Ludowinger tradition, he is named Ludwig. Though once the Margravine Adelheid II was the heir to the counties of Schmalkalden and Orlamünde, the lands are now split between the two children of Ludwig II, mimicking the succession of the Ruthenian lands in the east. Within the year, Bia is pregnant again.

Count Ludwig II did not heed his father's advice.

The Ludowinger family remains close after the death of their father, and bonds of alliance are negotiated between the landed brothers during a visit by Berengar to Schmalkalden. Additionally, Ludwig's sister and close friend Uta—the Duchess of Brittany by marriage—encourages close relations between Ludwig and the Duke of Brittany. Though Ludwig does not agree to a formal alliance, for the sake of his sister, he agrees to protect the interests of Uta's children should the Duke pass.

As the Kaiser moves what remaining troops he has south to deal with the Alpine Revolt, peasants in Bohemia take up arms against their liege. The current discontent is largely due to the perceived loyalty of the current Bohemian king Vratislav II toward the Kaiser Heinrich IV. Though Vratislav had taken up arms against the Kaiser only a few years prior, he was content with making peace in exchange for reduced feudal obligations. Bohemian lives were lost, and still Slavs are considered "outsiders" under German rule.

In response, a particularly influential merchant leader has declared himself the king of an independent Bohemia, and promises to liberate all Slavs from the Kaiser's tyrannical rule. With many of his own subjects taking up arms against him, the current King Vratislav II turns to the Kaiser for help.

Realizing his inability to fight a war on two fronts—and prioritizing access through the Alpine passes to the wealthy regions of Northern Italy—Kaiser Heinrich IV quickly negotiates a peace with the Slavic leader. In exchange for the independence of Slavs in and around Bohemia, the Kaiser would retain suzerainty over other Slavs in the Empire. The new King Tomasz of Bohemia agrees. The former King Vratislav II is now a furious Duke under the peasant king.

County Lobdaburg has a strong Polabian majority, and is a part of the Kaiser's concessions to King Tomasz. Before Ludwig's brother Count Berengar has a chance to return home from alliance negotiations in Schmalkalden to contest the treaty, King Tomasz installs a loyal Polabian count in the former Ludowinger castle. Ludwig quickly promises war to win back Berengar's rightful position as the Count of Lobdaburg. Independently, the former king Vratislav gathers troops loyal to himself to dethrone the Bohemian pretender.

War is declared.

Realizing this will mean goodbye while on campaign, Ludwig spends much "quality time" with his wife while war plans are being drawn up.
